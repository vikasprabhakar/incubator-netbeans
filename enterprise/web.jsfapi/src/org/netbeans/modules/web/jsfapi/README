The weird module's code name base org.netbeans.modules.jsfapi needs to be used
since the natural org.netbeans.modules.jsf is already taken by the legacy
"JSF Support" module.

This module is going to be a shared place for common JSF stuff from both JSF Common
and JSF Editor modules. Currently there are some dependencies problems between
these two which requires another common module. This however still needs to be done!
Right now the module contains only small portion of the classes which needs to
be shared.
